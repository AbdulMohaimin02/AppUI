# App-UI


## Summary

A dribble inspired UI made completely in Jetpack compose.
I decided to code this UI so that I can get more confident with using Google's new UI toolkit(Jetpack compose).

## What I learned 

For me understanding this UI was straightforward, I have much experience with working with Jetpack Compose on other smaller projects by myself. However, while building this UI I learned how to do more complex designs with kotlin, such as the wave pattern inside the featured section box.
