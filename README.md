# Meditation App UI 


## Description

A dribble inspired UI made completely in Jetpack compose.
I decided to code this UI so that I can get more confident with using Google's new UI toolkit(Jetpack compose). Additionally, I wanted to practice using more advanced kotlin functionality, such manually drawing paths inside compose elements.

Disclaimer: I am not the original author of this app, as this is an app that I made as a part of an online course. The objective of making this app was to learn how to implement custom paths inside compose elements and how to structure compose code inside app files.
